      <h3>Drawing</h3>
      <p>Drawing is a skill i developed when I was just a child. It often helps me clear my head by reflecting on and clarifying my thoughts and feelings.It helps me learn about myself. It helps me feel more happy and confident, and has given me an extra sense of identity and purpose in life.I often feel overwhelmed with work, to-do lists, and calendar appointments. Drawing my worries and thoughts helps me realize how unimportant all of those worries really are in the grand scheme of life. It reminds me how good life is. It brings me gratitude.</p>

      <h3>Reading</h3>
      <p>I enjoy reading because It's really funny to try to identify with the characters of the book and to imagine the environment. I think reading develops the brain and gives you the ability to understand other people. Besides, you develop your language if you read a lot because you learn new words all the time.</p>
